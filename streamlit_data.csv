"EnerVest Operating, LLC","The document is a comment submitted by EnerVest Operating, L.L.C. regarding proposed changes to Subpart W, OOOOb, OOOOc, and the methane waste taxes outlined in the Inflation Reduction Act and the Methane Emissions Reduction Program. EnerVest is an independent oil and natural gas operator with producing wells in Texas and Virginia, and they believe that these proposed changes will have a severe impact on their operations unless changes and clarifications are made to limit the impact on conventional marginal wells.

EnerVest supports the comments submitted by the Independent Petroleum Association of America and does not restate those arguments in their own comments. However, they provide additional comments on various aspects of the proposed changes.

They argue that the emission factors are increasing dramatically under the proposed changes without any basis in factual studies. They also believe that the time and cost estimates for implementing the revised regulations underestimate the additional burden and cost. They criticize the inclusion of water tank emissions in the revised rule, stating that these emissions are historically very low, difficult to measure, and have little impact on overall emissions reduction.

EnerVest also expresses concerns about the super emitter proposal, which allows third parties without training or licensure to allege super emissions, leading to costly reviews and responses. They argue that there are no changes or proposals that benefit or protect marginal conventional wells as intended by Congress. They give an example of eliminating factors for Eastern wells versus Western wells, which they believe is detrimental to marginal conventional wells.

The document also discusses specific aspects of the proposed rules, including engine methane emission factors, water tank emissions factors, intermittent bleed devices, liquid unloading, compressor venting, dump valves, and gathering and boosting. For each of these aspects, EnerVest provides their comments and suggestions for alternative approaches.

They also argue that the proposed changes do not address assumed emissions from pipelines in the Gathering & Boosting segment based solely on the miles of pipeline operated. They believe that emissions should be based on observed leaks and whether those leaks were repaired or not, rather than assuming emissions based on the miles of pipeline. They argue that responsible operators inspect their pipelines and repair leaks, and the regulations should only use emissions that are not repaired.

Finally, EnerVest urges the EPA to limit the definition of ""facility"" for oil and natural gas operations when calculating exceptions to the Methane Tax. They propose that a facility should be defined as a well pad site, whether for a single well or multiple wells, rather than including an entire basin as one facility.

Overall, EnerVest believes that unless changes are made to the proposed regulations, marginal well operators will be severely and irreparably damaged. They call for sensible amendments to Subpart W and the Methane Tax to protect their operations.",negative,"Based on the text provided, the statement is true.

Diversified Energy Company,"The document is a letter submitted by Diversified Energy Company to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. Diversified Energy Company is the largest operator of natural gas and oil wells in the United States and has been actively working to reduce methane emissions from its operations.

The letter highlights Diversified's commitment to voluntary methane reduction and measurement, with the company setting targets to reduce methane emissions intensity by 30% from their 2020 baseline by 2026 and 50% by 2030. Diversified is involved in various initiatives, including the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) program, and has earned the OGMP Gold Standard Pathway distinction.

Diversified expresses its support for effective and reasonable revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule that improve the completeness and accuracy of GHG reports without imposing significant additional burden on operators. They advocate for the use of empirical data and credible information to estimate GHG emissions wherever available.

The letter also addresses specific concerns with the proposed rules. Diversified disagrees with the EPA's characterization that very few facilities use laser-based instruments for leak detection, as they have been using such technology for years. They argue that laser-based technology, such as the Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) Remote Methane Leak Detector (RMLD), is superior to Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) in terms of accuracy and efficiency. They request that the current factors for laser-based leak detection be retained and that a performance-based approach be adopted.

David Allen,"The document is a comment submitted by Dr. David Allen, an environmental scientist specializing in oil and gas, on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal for estimating emissions from pneumatic controllers in the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Dr. Allen provides his expertise and suggests modifications to the proposed emission rate for properly functioning intermittent pneumatic controllers.

The comment is divided into four sections:

1. Overview of proposed methods for estimating emissions from pneumatic controllers: The EPA proposes three calculation methods for estimating emissions from pneumatic controllers, including measuring the gas fed to the controllers, measuring the gas vented from the controllers, and a calculation method based on identifying properly and improperly functioning controllers.

2. Significance of the default emission rate for properly functioning intermittent controllers: Dr. Allen highlights that the proposed default emission rate for properly functioning intermittent controllers is significant because it is likely to be widely implemented in the initial reporting years. He estimates that applying the default emission rate to approximately 1,000,000 pneumatic controllers in oil and gas operations would result in emissions of 25 billion cubic feet per year, representing approximately 0.07% of the gas produced in the United States annually.

3. Potential high bias in the default emission rate for properly functioning intermittent controllers: Dr. Allen argues that the default emission rate proposed by the EPA is based on data from studies conducted at gathering and boosting stations, which may not be representative of emission rates at production facilities. He suggests that the emission rates for properly functioning controllers at production sites are likely lower than the proposed default rate.

4. Potential alternatives for the default emission rate: Dr. Allen proposes two alternatives for estimating a default emission rate for properly functioning intermittent controllers. One approach is to use the emission factor derived from a larger data set provided by the American Petroleum Institute (API), which suggests a much lower emission rate than the EPA's proposed value. Another approach is to base the emission factor on data from a study conducted by Allen et al. (2015), which found an average emission rate for properly functioning controllers of 0.28 scf/hr.

In conclusion, Dr. Allen recommends using a default emission rate of 0.3 scf/hr for properly functioning intermittent pneumatic controllers, as he believes the proposed default rate overestimates emissions from these devices at production sites. He suggests that this modification would have a significant impact on total estimated emissions from the natural gas and petroleum production sectors.

Downstream Natural Gas Initiative,"The document is a comment letter submitted by the Downstream Natural Gas Initiative (DSI) in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed revisions to Subpart W of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. The DSI is a group of natural gas utilities working towards a low-carbon future and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The DSI's comments focus on provisions in the proposed rule that affect methane reporting for natural gas distribution facilities and certain other intrastate Subpart W facilities operated by natural gas local distribution companies (LDCs).

One of the key points made by the DSI is the alignment of emission factors used in the Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) and Subpart W. They support using the Lamb et al. study (Lamb Study) and the leaks per mile rates from the 1996 GRI/EPA study for distribution main and service population emission factors. They argue that using the Weller Study leaks per mile rates for mains would lead to a significant divergence between the emission factors in the GHGI and Subpart W.

The DSI also comments on the inclusion of new emissions sources in the proposed rule. They support the addition of ""other large release events"" as an emissions source but propose a higher threshold for reporting for the distribution segment. They also request that EPA provides explicit text to calculate emission events using data from third-party notifications and represent any CH4 or CO2e release threshold with an equivalent estimated volumetric rate.

Regarding methane slip, the DSI agrees with EPA's proposal to quantify and report combustion slip from Subpart W facilities but requests further clarification on the definition of ""pipeline quality"" gas.

The DSI supports the addition of blowdown vent stacks as an emissions source for storage stations and distribution systems. They request that the threshold for reporting a blowdown should apply to equipment with a unique physical volume of 500 cubic feet or more for the distribution segment.

The DSI also provides comments on crankcase venting, new sources for transmission pipelines, and the updating of emission factors. They request additional flexibility in allowing the option to estimate emissions using actual leak data for pipeline leaks and interconnects/farm taps. They also support the use of direct measurements to quantify emissions and suggest using company-specific data and advanced methane detection technologies.

The DSI makes general comments and requests for EPA to consider, including providing a definition of ""empirical data,"" extending the timeline for implementation of the rule, and allowing the use of Best Available Monitoring Methods (BAMM) for an interim period.

The EMA represents companies that manufacture engines used in petroleum and natural gas systems, such as compressor stations.

The EMA's comments focus on ensuring that the proposed rule does not go beyond the scope of regulating petroleum and natural gas systems and impact the engines themselves. They argue that the EPA should emphasize in the final rule that it is limited to petroleum and natural gas systems and does not affect stationary reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) regulations under the Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 111.

The EMA also raises concerns about the proposed rule's language regarding crankcase ventilation emissions and combustion slip measurements. They argue that any language implying that these issues apply beyond the petroleum and natural gas systems source category should be removed or edited. They assert that the proposed rule does not provide notice or analysis of the impact on engine manufacturers and that any action to regulate RICE and gas turbines should be subject to a separate notice and comment period.

Regarding the requirements of CAA § 136(h), which requires reporting based on empirical data, the EMA supports the EPA's proposal to allow the use of manufacturer data, emission factors, and source testing for quantifying combustion slip emissions. They argue that these options satisfy the empirical criterion required by Congress and minimize the burden of reporting requirements.

The EMA opposes the inclusion of a new testing program for engine manufacturers in this rulemaking. They argue that such testing is outside the scope of the proposed rule, presents issues and complications that have not been addressed, and imposes costs that have not been evaluated.

In the letter, Enerplus expresses support for revisions to the rule that allow operators to use empirical data and credible information to estimate GHG emissions where available. They believe that these revisions will improve the completeness and accuracy of GHG reports without imposing significant additional burden on reporters.

Enerplus specifically provides comments on several elements of the proposed rulemaking. They express concerns about the proposed changes to monitoring requirements for flares, stating that these changes would increase company spending on emissions monitoring without providing improved emissions reduction benefits. They request that the EPA remove the tiered control efficiency for flares from the final rule and allow operators to claim the control efficiency that is most appropriate and justifiable based on manufacturer's guarantee or applicable regulatory requirement.

The letter also addresses the timing and interrelatedness of the proposed changes with other federal regulations, such as the CAA Section 111(b) Standards of Performance for Certain New, Reconstructed, and Modified Oil and Natural Gas Sources (NSPS OOOOb) and the Inflation Reduction Act Section 60113 methane emissions reduction program's waste emission charge for oil and gas facilities (MERP WEC). Enerplus urges the EPA to develop and communicate a plan to ensure coordination and synchronization of all associated regulations.

Another topic discussed in the letter is the designation of ""Gathering and Boosting"" versus ""Production"" segments. Enerplus points out that the proposed rule erroneously classifies centralized oil production sites under the gathering and boosting segment, which introduces discrepancies between this rule and other federal programs and complicates reporting requirements. They recommend that the EPA change the name of the subject facility to ""centralized production facility"" and retain the classification as onshore production for consistency.

The letter also addresses issues related to large release events, leaker emission factors, compressor venting, and produced water tanks. Enerplus provides recommendations and suggestions for each of these topics.

Overall, the letter emphasizes the importance of aligning the final rule with other pending rules impacting the industry to minimize ambiguity, avoid conflicting requirements, and reduce the cost and complexity of compliance for operators.

Protect PT,"The document is a comment provided by Tom Pike, an environmental policy advocate with Protect PT, during a hearing. Tom Pike expresses support for the proposed rule and suggests that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) incorporate revisions suggested by the Environmental Defense Fund. 

Tom Pike highlights the issue of abandoned and orphaned wells in Southwestern Pennsylvania, which are documented by the EPA and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). He mentions that there are even more wells that are not officially recorded. Pike emphasizes that emissions from these sources, particularly methane, are a serious concern as methane is 82 times more potent at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. He also notes that all gas infrastructure leaks to some extent, and the industry often ignores leaks that are considered ""insignificant"".

Pike criticizes the EPA and the DEP for falling short in safeguarding public health and mentions that his organization is conducting air monitoring instead. He argues that the EPA should step in and take action to fill the gap left by regulatory agencies. Pike also mentions that the State of Pennsylvania has not fulfilled its obligations under the state constitution, which grants the right to clean air and water.

The proposed rule is seen as a way to address gaps in measuring methane emissions. Pike emphasizes the importance of remote sensing to accurately measure the scale of the problem and provide the EPA with a tool to impose future restrictions on methane infrastructure. He suggests that the long-term solution is to create a burden on the industry that reflects the true cost of doing business, as the gas industry has historically socialized costs and privatized profits.

Pike provides a personal example of the potential harm caused by the industry, mentioning that his parents' drinking water, along with that of 80,000 other people, comes from a reservoir called Beaver Run. He highlights the presence of methane fracking wells located near the reservoir and includes pictures to illustrate the situation. Pike strongly asserts that his parents are being poisoned and calls for regulations to hold the industry accountable.

The letter is addressed to a representative of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and is in support of the proposed revisions to Subpart W of 40 CFR Part 98, which pertains to emissions reporting and methane reduction efforts in the oil and gas industry.

Kathairos Solutions specializes in reducing emissions from the energy industry, particularly methane emissions from pneumatic devices used in upstream oil and gas operations. The company's technology eliminates methane venting from pneumatics by replacing the power gas used to actuate the devices with nitrogen, a clean and inert gas. This is achieved by installing a specialized cryogenic tank at the well site and filling it with liquid nitrogen. The nitrogen is then released in gaseous form at the pressures and quantities needed for everyday operations. The tanks are manufactured by Chart Industries, a global leader in cryogenic manufacturing.

The letter highlights the environmental toll of routine methane venting from pneumatics, estimating that 70 million tons of CO2 equivalent is emitted from over 350,000 well sites in the United States. Kathairos Solutions' technology has experienced rapid adoption across the industry, with operations expanded across 15 regions in North America and over 1000 tanks deployed in the past year and a half alone. The nitrogen-based solution has become the preferred zero-vent solution for North America's largest oil and gas companies due to its economic and reliable nature.

The letter expresses support for the proposed revisions to Subpart W, specifically regarding changes and revisions to Section E pertaining to pneumatics. Kathairos Solutions does not have any significant objections to the proposed calculation methods or reporting requirements. The company believes that the metering and monitoring technologies contemplated in the revisions are generally accurate and available. They also argue that existing population-based emission factors are not accurate and misrepresent actual methane emissions. The closed-loop nature of Kathairos' nitrogen-based solution allows for precise measurement of methane that would have otherwise been vented, and they support the EPA's proposed revisions to improve the accuracy of emissions reporting.

The letter also emphasizes that companies that have voluntarily undertaken efforts to reduce or eliminate their emissions should not face undue burdens with respect to reporting. Kathairos Solutions believes that eliminating emissions should always be the easiest course of action from a reporting and compliance standpoint. They offer their support to provide further insight into their technology and robust pneumatics vent rate data to the EPA upon request.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ),"The document is a letter from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the EPA's proposed Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. The TCEQ provides comments on the proposed amendments and offers suggestions for improvement.

The proposed rule amendments aim to improve the calculation, monitoring, and reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from petroleum and natural gas facilities. The amendments include new emission calculation methodologies, additional sources subject to reporting, technical amendments, clarifications, and corrections. The EPA also proposes to establish and amend confidentiality determinations for certain data elements.

The TCEQ provides specific comments on the proposed amendments. Firstly, they support the proposed use of the gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) method for determining atmospheric storage tank flash emissions for GHGs. They state that the GOR method, along with other methodologies, is currently used in Texas to determine storage tank emissions and establish potential to emit (PTE) for air permitting of volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions.

Secondly, the TCEQ encourages the EPA to allow flexibility in calculating emissions using measured operating conditions, design parameters, or air permit PTE basis for applicable facilities. They argue that the proposed revisions should consider the use of empirical data obtained at the facility for determining source emissions, as well as the use of worst-case scenarios for emissions calculations. They suggest that the calculation methodologies included in the GHGRP can be used for determining authorized PTE emission rates in various air permitting mechanisms.

Thirdly, the TCEQ expresses concern about the change in default combustion efficiency for flares. They argue that requiring monitoring to demonstrate a combustion efficiency of 98 percent creates a significant regulatory burden with little benefit. They recommend revising the proposed rule's default combustion efficiency and outlining specific control monitoring requirements if certain proposed rules are not finalized.

Lastly, the TCEQ disagrees with the inclusion of ""other large release events"" in the GHGRP requirements. They argue that the proposed reporting requirements for these events, such as well blowouts or equipment ruptures, are unnecessary and burdensome. They suggest that the EPA should reconsider the overall effectiveness and necessity of the super-emitter response program included in proposed rules and provide clear guidance on acceptable methods for detecting and quantifying super-emitter leaks.

"Providence Photonics, LLC","The document being summarized is a comment submitted by Providence Photonics, LLC in response to the proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. Providence Photonics is a developer of technologies related to flare efficiency measurement and gas leak detection in the oil and gas industry.

The comment begins by highlighting Providence Photonics' expertise in developing technologies such as Video Imaging Spectral Radiometry (VISR) for measuring flare performance and optical gas imaging for gas leak detection. They state that they have accumulated a substantial body of knowledge related to flare efficiency and its measurement.

The comment then focuses on two specific aspects of the proposed rule: flare combustion efficiency and flare flowrate measurement.

Regarding flare combustion efficiency, the comment discusses the difference between Combustion Efficiency (CE) and Destruction Efficiency (DE). CE refers to the fraction of hydrocarbon fuel oxidized to carbon dioxide, while DE refers to the fraction of hydrocarbon fuel destroyed, which may or may not be fully oxidized to carbon dioxide. The comment argues that lumping CE and DE together as ""combustion efficiency"" in the proposed rule is inconsistent with other flare regulations and suggests using DE for methane emission calculations and CE for carbon dioxide emission calculations.

The comment also suggests revising the proposed tiered approach for determining flare combustion efficiency. They propose allowing GHG reporters to directly measure DE using validated methods or implementing continuous monitoring of flare Net Heating Value Combustion Zone (NHVcz) and using bracketed DE values based on NHVcz. They argue that the proposed tiered approach may underestimate flare control efficiency and overestimate methane emissions.

Regarding flare flowrate measurement, the comment suggests allowing the use of VISR-based remote flare gas flowrate measurement as an alternative to flowmeters. They argue that this method can provide more accurate flowrate measurements, especially for flares without flowmeters or when flowrates are very low.

Lastly, the comment suggests using the VISR device to monitor the presence of the pilot flame in flares, as it is a maintenance-free method that can be combined with continuous monitoring of NHVcz and flow measurement.

The comment references several exhibits, including supporting data in Excel format, a technical presentation on VISR, EPA-sponsored VISR method testing, aggregated results of flare performance, and flare gas flowrate measurement by VISR.

Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA),"The document is a letter from the Alaska Oil and Gas Association (AOGA) to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding proposed revisions and confidentiality determinations for petroleum and natural gas systems under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. AOGA provides comments on several areas of the proposed rule, including destruction efficiency for turbine compressor-drivers, the definition of ""pipeline quality gas"" for combustion emission units, the definition of ""centralized oil production site,"" natural gas turbine crankcase venting, reporting ""other large release events,"" and the definition and scope of the ""gathering and boosting"" segment.

In regards to destruction efficiency for turbine compressor-drivers, AOGA supports the incorporated destruction efficiency for turbine compressor drivers of 0.999 within the proposed rule. 

AOGA suggests that the EPA should define ""pipeline quality gas"" for combustion emission units located within the Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Production and Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting sectors. They propose adopting a definition based on the existing definitions of ""Natural Gas"" and ""Pipeline Natural Gas"" from EPA regulations developed for the Acid Rain Program.

AOGA requests that the EPA revises the definition of ""centralized oil production site"" to clarify that process tanks are not considered storage tanks. They propose a definition for ""process tank"" to provide clarity and consistency with other similar storage tank/vessel rules in EPA regulations.

Regarding natural gas turbine crankcase venting, AOGA argues that natural gas turbines should not be included for reporting crankcase venting as there are no crankcase vents on natural gas turbines. They propose that any leakage would be reported as fugitive emissions to avoid double counting of emissions.

AOGA suggests that source-specific reports should not exclude emissions from ""other large release events"" as it could dilute the data associated with those source types. They propose revisions to the language to clarify reporting requirements for other large release events.

Lastly, AOGA provides clarification on the definition and scope of the gathering and boosting segment, particularly in relation to central facilities in Alaska. They explain that central facilities do not meet the definition of the Onshore Petroleum and Natural Gas Gathering and Boosting industry segment and should continue to report emissions under Part 98 Subpart C.

David Allen,"The document is a comment submitted by Dr. David Allen, an environmental scientist specializing in oil and gas, on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposal for the ""Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems."" Dr. Allen provides expertise on methane emissions from oil and gas operations.

The comment is divided into five sections:

1. Project Astra Overview: Dr. Allen describes Project Astra, a network of fixed methane emission monitors in the Permian Basin oil and gas production region in West Texas. The network has been monitoring emissions from approximately 50 production sites since 2022. The Permian Basin was chosen for this demonstration due to its large volume of production and simple topography. Project Astra operates as a regional network, taking advantage of the proximity of sites to enhance the advantages of a shared network of sensors.

2. Methane Sensor/Monitor Characterization and Testing: Dr. Allen explains that Project Astra is developing an innovative sensor network using advances in methane-sensing technologies, data sharing, and data analytics. The project has completed sensor testing, evaluating seven solar-powered methane sensing systems for nine months at a production site in the Permian Basin. Four sensor systems demonstrated sufficient precision to detect emissions of 5-100+ kg/hr under meteorological conditions in the region.

3. Monitoring Network Design: The design of the monitoring network depends on the emission rate to be detected. The initial design of the network was based on dispersion modeling of emissions from each site in the test region. Simulations indicate that less than one continuous monitor per site is capable of consistently detecting emissions in the range of 100 kg/hr within an average of less than one day of the onset of emissions.

4. Detecting and Estimating the Duration of Large Release Events: Dr. Allen discusses how continuous monitoring systems like Project Astra can detect large methane release events. Case studies using dispersion modeling and meteorological data from Project Astra show that even with just one continuous sensor deployed per site, the average time required to detect a large emission event (100 kg/hr) is less than a day.

5. Summary of Main Points: The comment summarizes the main points, including the performance of the sensor systems tested in Project Astra, the capability of the monitoring network to detect emissions in the Permian Basin, and the efficiency of continuous monitoring systems in detecting large release events.

Carbon Mapper and RMI,"The document titled ""Carbon Mapper and RMI Comments on EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems"" provides detailed comments and recommendations from Carbon Mapper and RMI (Rocky Mountain Institute) on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed revisions to Subpart W of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The authors express their support for EPA's efforts to improve the accuracy, completeness, and transparency of emissions reporting in the oil and gas sector.

The authors highlight the importance of accurately measuring and reporting methane emissions from the oil and gas sector to inform mitigation efforts and track progress. They acknowledge that the current estimation methods used in Subpart W, which are based on bottom-up (component level, emission factor-based) approaches, systematically underestimate annual methane emissions, particularly those from large, episodic emissions or ""super-emitters."" The authors support EPA's proposed updates to fill these critical gaps with updated emission calculation methodologies, increased granularity, and new source categories based on top-down, empirical data.

The document provides several recommendations to strengthen the accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness of Subpart W. These recommendations include:

1. Further integrating top-down data, including basin-level observations alongside site- and equipment-level measurements, to improve the accuracy of reported emissions.

2. Using funds from the Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) to support monitoring of large release events.

3. Providing necessary resources and guidelines for reporting and validation.

4. Increasing the accuracy and scope of pipeline emissions covered by GHGRP.

The authors emphasize the need for EPA to integrate top-down measurements at the basin-, site-, and equipment-level to validate and improve the accuracy of reported emissions. They suggest using basin-level observations to evaluate the extent of unreported or underreported emissions and inform potential revisions to Subpart W. Site-level and equipment-level measurement data can supplement operator-reported emissions and provide valuable empirical data for the ""other large release event"" category.

The document also discusses the implementation considerations for effective operator and third-party reporting and validation. The authors recommend that EPA fund third-party remote sensing and transparent reporting with MERP grants. They suggest that EPA should build out technical staff capacity to support self-reported and third-party-submitted observational data. Additionally, EPA should develop clear guidelines for data collection and validation standards and establish a robust and consistent framework to support decision-making regarding responses to large release event observations.

Furthermore, the document highlights the need to increase the accuracy and scope of pipeline emissions covered by GHGRP. The authors recognize EPA's efforts to update gathering line emission factors and provide alternative ways for monitoring gathering lines using more empirical data. However, they point out fundamental gaps in how gathering lines are regulated, resulting in significant undocumented emissions. The authors suggest that EPA should require emission events to be reported by either upstream or midstream operators if detected leaks exceed the thresholds for large release events. They also recommend aligning leak survey guidelines for pipelines with the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) and utilizing empirical data to develop leaker emission factors for all pipeline types.

Peter Furcht,"The document is a statement made by Peter Furcht, a private citizen from Philadelphia, expressing his concerns about the fossil fuel industry's impact on the environment and marginalized populations. Furcht argues that while he acknowledges the necessity of the industry, it should not come at the expense of humanity and the environment. He criticizes the industry for denying climate disruption, emitting greenhouse gases without cost or concern, and prioritizing profits over the health of those affected by their activities.

Furcht proposes that the entire fossil fuel industry, regardless of size or profitability, should be required to report every single greenhouse gas emission, with no exceptions. He emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting and suggests that there should be significant penalties for any transgressions. Furcht acknowledges that the industry may argue that producing these reports is costly, but he believes that the cost of emitting has not been properly accounted for and has been borne by the general population indirectly.

He highlights the various ways in which individuals indirectly pay for emissions, such as healthcare expenses, increased costs for flood insurance, higher air conditioning bills, and anxiety about the future. Furcht argues that the fossil fuel industry should directly bear the costs of emitting, rather than passing them on to consumers. He suggests that once accurate reporting is in place, legislators can implement pay-to-emit programs, shifting the responsibility and cost of emissions to the producers.

Furcht acknowledges that the industry may pass on the reporting and pay-to-emit costs to consumers, but argues that consumers can then choose which products to buy, allowing them to control their costs related to emissions.

"Bridger Photonics, Inc.","The document is a comment letter submitted by Bridger Photonics, Inc. in response to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Proposed Rule on Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. Bridger Photonics is a company specializing in the detection, localization, and quantification of methane emissions, particularly in the oil and gas industry.

In the letter, Bridger Photonics expresses appreciation for the opportunity to provide feedback on the Proposed Rule and highlights their expertise in methane emissions measurement. They offer five specific recommendations to improve the accuracy of methane emissions reporting while reducing complexity:

1. Remove incentives to use less-effective emissions monitoring technology: Bridger argues that the proposed reporting requirement for ""other large release events"" unintentionally incentivizes operators to use less-effective emissions monitoring technologies. They suggest following Colorado's Greenhouse Gas Intensity Verification rule, which scales bottom-up model reported emissions to match measured methane emissions, as a more effective approach.

2. Fund the development of regional measurement-based methane emissions inventories: Bridger recommends using direct measurements to develop regional inventories of methane emissions. They argue that this approach, similar to Colorado's approach, would provide accurate reporting and allow for the identification and reconciliation of discrepancies between bottom-up models and measured emissions.

3. Allow operators to demonstrate low emissions at their reporting facilities by developing facility-level measurement-based methane emissions inventories: Bridger suggests that operators should be able to demonstrate reduced methane emissions at their reporting facilities using approved measurement-based inventory development methods. This would align with the intent of the IRA and provide operators with the option to show reduced emissions based on their infrastructure.

4. Create a pathway to approve and update methods for developing measurement-based methane emissions inventories: Bridger recommends establishing an approval pathway for frameworks and technologies used to develop measurement-based inventories. They emphasize the importance of accurate emissions reporting and suggest using robust frameworks and technologies that meet specific performance criteria.

5. Allow operators to use direct measurements to report gathering pipeline emissions: Bridger argues that the Proposed Rule should allow operators to use direct measurements, rather than relying solely on emissions factors, to report gathering line emissions. They suggest harmonizing gathering pipeline emissions reporting with other EPA and PHMSA provisions and allowing operators to use advanced technology and suitable measurement methods.

Throughout the letter, Bridger Photonics emphasizes the importance of accurate methane emissions reporting and the need for measurement-based inventories.

Antero Midstream Corporation,"The document is a submission of comments by Antero Resources, an integrated midstream service provider in the oil and gas industry, regarding the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Antero expresses its support for the use of empirical data in reporting greenhouse gas emissions and suggests a specific provision that does not align with this directive.

The first comment made by Antero is related to the calculation of emissions from reciprocating internal combustion engines (RICE) and gas turbines (GT) when using fuel with a methane content less than 85%. The EPA proposes a default equipment-specific combustion efficiency for these engines, which operators must use to calculate emissions. Antero argues that operators should be allowed to determine emissions through direct measurement using a performance test if they can demonstrate limited fuel composition variability, even if the methane content is less than 85%. Antero provides its own empirical data from 19 compressor stations, showing that the methane content of the fuel had an average percent change of only 1.0% over a three-year period, indicating low fuel composition variability.

The second comment suggests that if the EPA is still concerned about fuel composition variability, a mechanism should be adopted to allow operators to demonstrate limited variability and report emissions through direct measurement using a performance test. Antero proposes quarterly fuel gas sampling and submission of data alongside annual emissions reports to verify that the fuel composition has not varied beyond a negligible amount, such as 5% over the course of the year. This would allow operators to utilize performance-testing procedures to measure and report emissions if their facility-specific data demonstrates limited fuel composition variability.

Antero emphasizes the importance of accurate emissions reporting based on empirical data to align with the principles of the Inflation Reduction Act, which requires reporting to be based on empirical data and accurately reflect total methane emissions. The company supports EPA's efforts to increase the reliability of greenhouse gas reporting and appreciates the consideration of its comments.

Arkansas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners (AIPRO),"The document is a comment submitted by the Arkansas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners (AIPRO) Association in response to the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems. The comment incorporates and supports the comments previously submitted by the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA) and the American Petroleum Institute (API).

The AIPRO comment begins by acknowledging the efforts made by the oil and gas industry to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and highlights the industry's dissatisfaction with the EPA's current GHG reporting regulations. They argue that the EPA's ""one-size fits all"" approach to calculating emissions factors often leads to overestimation of GHG emissions. AIPRO recommends that the EPA collaborate with industry groups to develop updated regulations that allow for the use of empirical data and promote innovation in emissions reductions.

The comment also addresses concerns related to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the associated ""Waste Emissions Charge"" or methane tax. AIPRO argues that the proposed revisions to Subpart W of the GHG Reporting Rule fail to meet the legislative mandate of the IRA, which requires reporting based on empirical data. They criticize the proposed timelines for implementation and suggest that the EPA's revisions do not adequately address the inaccuracies in the current emissions calculation methodologies.

AIPRO further discusses the interrelatedness of the proposed GHG Reporting Rule revisions with other regulations, such as New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Emission Guidelines (EG) for the oil and gas industry. They express concerns about the use of historical GHG reporting data, which they believe is of poor quality and inaccurate, as the basis for proposed regulations. AIPRO argues that this approach may lead to double-counting of emissions and calls for a comprehensive review and amendment of the proposed revisions.

The comment also addresses specific issues related to various emissions sources, including intermittent bleed pneumatic devices, low-bleed pneumatic devices, centrifugal and reciprocating compressor venting, methane slip from internal combustion equipment, produced water tanks, equipment leak surveys, well venting for liquids unloading, crankcase venting, and acid gas removal units. AIPRO provides recommendations for each source category, highlighting concerns about burdensome requirements, inaccuracies in emissions factors, and potential safety hazards.

In conclusion, AIPRO argues that the proposed revisions to the GHG Reporting Rule, particularly Subpart W, are inadequate and fail to meet the legislative mandate of the IRA. They call for the withdrawal of the proposed revisions and a comprehensive review and validation of the regulations to ensure accuracy and reliability.

Oceana,"The document is a letter submitted by Oceana, an international conservation organization focused on protecting the world's oceans, to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the proposed greenhouse gas reporting rule. The letter expresses concern that the EPA is failing to adequately update offshore emissions reporting requirements, specifically in relation to methane emissions from oil and gas operations.

The letter argues that the EPA's reliance on the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's (BOEM) Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Emissions Inventory is problematic because it significantly undercounts methane emissions according to several studies. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas released during offshore drilling operations, and addressing its emissions is crucial for limiting global warming.

The letter highlights the Inflation Reduction Act, which mandates that the EPA's reporting and calculation of waste emissions charges be based on empirical data and accurately reflect total methane emissions. The EPA's proposed changes to the greenhouse gas reporting rule are criticized for not meeting this mandate for offshore facilities. The letter suggests that the EPA should either apply the same reporting requirements for onshore and offshore facilities or work with BOEM to update the offshore requirements to align with the Inflation Reduction Act.

The document also discusses the shortcomings of BOEM's OCS Emissions Inventory in accurately reflecting actual methane emissions from offshore facilities. It cites studies that have found underestimations of methane emissions and argues that the EPA's proposed changes are unlikely to address this issue effectively.

The letter recommends that the EPA include reliance on top-down measurements, such as remote sensing and aerial surveys, for validation of reported data and expand direct measurement requirements for offshore facilities to increase the accuracy of reported data. It also suggests that the EPA should include additional reporting requirements related to the verification of reported emissions, such as data from flare/vent meters.

Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA),"The document is a letter submitted by the Permian Basin Petroleum Association (PBPA) to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule (GHGRP) for petroleum and natural gas systems. The PBPA represents oil and gas industry workers in the Permian Basin, the largest oil and gas producing region in the world.

The letter begins by stating that the proposed rule would significantly increase the number of oil and gas operators subject to methane emissions reporting requirements. The PBPA argues that this expansion is not consistent with the Intentional Reduction Act (IRA), which exempts certain operations from emissions fees. They claim that the proposed rule would impact small and medium-sized producers, contrary to the intent of the legislation.

The PBPA criticizes the proposed rule for being based on faulty modeling, data, and analysis. They argue that the rule fails to achieve its intended purpose of reducing emissions and would have no benefit to the environment or the economy. The PBPA suggests that the rule should be withdrawn and revised to align with the IRA and the intent of Congress.

The letter also highlights specific technical flaws in the proposed rule. The PBPA argues that the rule does not incentivize the use of proven monitoring technologies and instead imposes unrealistic emission factors. They provide examples of how these flaws would result in unrealistic and inflated emission totals, which would negatively impact their members' reputation and finances.

Furthermore, the PBPA criticizes the EPA for incorporating requirements from other proposed rules, such as the New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) and Emissions Guidelines (EG), which have not been finalized. They argue that referencing these rules in the GHGRP proposal is presumptive and could lead to inconsistencies and confusion.

The letter concludes by requesting that the EPA revise the proposed rule to ensure that reporting is based on empirical data and aligns with the IRA and the intent of Congress. The PBPA emphasizes the importance of accurate reporting without imposing unnecessary costs or inaccuracies.

Michigan Oil and Gas Association (MOGA),"The document is a letter from the Michigan Oil and Gas Association (MOGA) to the EPA Administrator, Michael S. Regan, regarding the proposed Revisions and Confidentiality Determination for Petroleum and Natural Gas System. MOGA represents small businesses engaged in the oil and gas industry in Michigan and seeks to provide input on the potential impacts of the proposed rule.

MOGA initially intended to request an extension for commenting on the proposed modifications due to the complexity and integration of various regulations related to methane emissions reduction. However, after reviewing the EPA's denial letters for extension requests, MOGA decided to provide comments instead. The organization supports other commenters who called for the withdrawal of the proposed rule until other related regulations are finalized.

MOGA urges the EPA to consider the concerns of small businesses in the industry before finalizing regulations that may be technically and financially infeasible. They emphasize the importance of small businesses being able to understand and implement regulations for compliance success. However, MOGA states that the current state of proposed regulations is interrelated and difficult to understand, making it challenging to provide sufficient comment on the potential impacts to the industry.

The letter then provides several specific comments on surficial issues proposed in the regulations:

1. Department of Energy (DOE) Marginal Well Study: MOGA recommends including the results of the DOE study, which clarified the differences in potential emissions from marginal wells vs. non-marginal wells, in the proposed emission factors for revisions to Subpart W.

2. Imperial vs. Metric: MOGA argues that all proposed regulations should use accepted methodologies and cater to the least common denominator in terms of raw data collection. They suggest that unnecessary conversions between different units of measurement may lead to incorrect data sets and improper conclusions.

3. Approval of Independent Engineering Calculations for Emission Determination: MOGA applauds the EPA for allowing independent emission determination using alternative procedures and calculations. However, they express concern about the lack of clarification, defined procedures, and response time for the EPA's approval process. MOGA believes that a detailed process and procedure, including a specified time for approval, are necessary for providing specific comments on the proposed regulations.

4. Off-Ramp Inclusion: MOGA supports the EPA's proposal to allow temporary or final cessation of reporting when emissions fall below certain levels. However, they are concerned about the potential costs associated with continued reporting during this timeframe. They argue that when throughput declines to marginal well levels, continued reporting will add untenable costs and may lead to early well plugging. MOGA suggests removing subsequent reporting after off-ramping or reducing the reporting timeframe to two years to account for depletion.

5. Clarification of Exemptions proposed in NSPS OOOOb & OOOOc and the IRA: MOGA states that the exemptions proposed in these regulations are not clear or specifically outlined. They recommend that the EPA specify exemptions before requesting comments on modifications to the Subpart W calculations that may have financial implications.

6. Regulation Dates & Timelines: MOGA expresses concern about the variation in proposed regulation timelines. They highlight that the IRA and subsequent Waste Emission Charges are set to take place in 2024, while the proposed calculation methodologies for Subpart W will not take effect until January 1, 2025. MOGA is concerned that emission estimates may be overstated, resulting in taxation beyond actual estimates before independent analysis of actual emissions is allowed. They believe that proposed regulations should align to allow inclusion of actual emissions.

7. Estimated vs. Actual Emissions: MOGA's constituents are concerned that current and proposed Subpart W emissions factors overestimate emissions and do not accurately reflect actual emissions. They recommend that the EPA develop and propose specific, cost-efficient methodologies that would allow all operators, including small businesses, to calculate actual emissions.

In conclusion, MOGA appreciates the opportunity to comment on the proposed Subpart W modifications but finds the timing of the proposed regulations inconsistent with unfinalized concurrent regulations that may impact the current proposed regulations.

"AQC Environmental Brokerage Services, Inc.","The document is a response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) proposed rule ""Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule: Revisions and Confidentiality Determinations for Petroleum and Natural Gas Systems."" The specific section being addressed is ""4. Compressors Routed to Controls."" 

The EPA is proposing to remove references to thermal oxidizers as emissions dispositions and instead categorize emissions routed to thermal oxidizers as ""routed to combustion."" The author of the response letter disagrees with this proposal and argues for the retention of references to thermal oxidizers while adding a specification for whether the thermal oxidizers incorporate energy recovery or not. 

The author provides several key considerations for retaining references to thermal oxidizers and adding the energy recovery specification. Firstly, they argue that it contributes to regulatory clarity and consistency, aligning with prevailing industry norms and providing clarity on the control technology in operation. Secondly, they suggest that it further incentivizes technological advancements by promoting cleaner technologies and fostering innovation in emissions mitigation. 

Thirdly, the author argues that retaining references to thermal oxidizers ensures precise emissions accounting and improved data elements. They believe that substituting the term ""routed to combustion"" may introduce ambiguity into emissions reporting and that distinguishing between thermal oxidizers with and without energy recovery would provide more accurate data for informed decision-making. 

Fourthly, the author highlights the importance of aligning with methane emissions reduction efforts. They state that thermal oxidizers play a pivotal role in mitigating methane emissions and that their retention in reporting frameworks facilitates a more accurate evaluation of advancements in curbing methane emissions across industries. They argue that removing references to thermal oxidizers could discourage the adoption of cleaner emission control technologies and impede progress towards sustainable emission reduction practices. 

Lastly, the author emphasizes that thermal oxidizers are an effective methane mitigation technology, citing data from the EPA's Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks. They suggest that enabling reporting under Subpart C for compressors and pneumatic controllers that utilize thermal oxidizers can hasten the reduction of fugitive methane emissions. 

In conclusion, the author urges the EPA to retain references to thermal oxidizers under Subpart W, arguing that it provides regulatory clarity, supports industry adoption of responsible emission control practices, and aligns with the EPA's methane emissions reduction objectives.

American Petroleum Institute (API),"The document is a memorandum from Karin Ritter, Manager of Corporate Policy at the American Petroleum Institute (API), to Mark DeFigueiredo, Melissa Weitz, and Adam Eisele of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Climate Change Division. The memorandum provides the results of the API Field Measurement Study of Pneumatic Controllers and proposes a two-tiered emission factor for controllers.

The API field study found that the average emission rate for properly functioning intermittent controllers was 0.28 standard cubic feet per hour (scfh), while malfunctioning intermittent controllers had an average emission rate of 24.1 scfh. The overall average emission rate for all intermittent controllers was 9.3 scfh. Continuous low bleed controllers had an average emission rate of 2.6 scfh, and continuous high bleed controllers had an average emission rate of 16.4 scfh. Malfunctioning intermittent pneumatic controllers accounted for about 85% of observed pneumatic controller emissions and 98% of observed intermittent pneumatic controller emissions.

These results are consistent with prior studies that found a small number of malfunctioning intermittent controllers accounted for the majority of pneumatic controller emissions. Based on these findings, API proposes that EPA modify 40 CFR Part 98 Subpart W to include a two-tier intermittent pneumatic controller emission factor option for controllers included in a qualified inspection and repair program. The proposed emission factors are 0.28 scfh for properly functioning controllers and 24.1 scfh for malfunctioning controllers. Intermittent controllers not included in a qualified inspection and repair program would continue to use the current emission factor of 13.5 scfh.

API suggests that EPA may wish to include data from prior studies to calculate a set of tiered emission factors from a wider dataset. The document also mentions that OGI inspection of intermittent pneumatic controllers is the technique used by EPA and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment in their recently published study.

The document includes an API paper titled ""Pneumatic Controller Inventory and Measurement at 67 Oil and Gas Sites in the Western United States,"" an excel file with data tables for the study, and API's responses to EPA's questions received prior to a conference call on January 13, 2020.

Physicians for Social Responsibility Pennsylvania (PSR),"The document is a statement from Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR) Pennsylvania, a public health nonprofit organization advocating for social and environmental justice in Pennsylvania. The organization highlights the harmful effects of fracking on public health and emphasizes the need to reduce methane emissions and advocate for methane safeguards to improve air and water quality, as well as overall health.

The document references a Compendium on Scientific, Medical, and Media Findings Demonstrating Risks and Harms of oil and gas drilling published by PSR and Concerned Health Professionals of New York. According to this compendium, individuals living near oil and gas operations are at increased risk of heart disease, lung disease, asthma, infertility, various cancers (such as Acute Lymphatic Leukemia and Ewing Sarcoma), eczema, and reduced lifespan compared to those living farther away from such sites.

As a public health professional, the author of the document requests that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) ensures the reporting of certain information to the Subpart W of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The requested reporting changes include:

1. Reports should be based on empirical data.
2. Reports should accurately reflect total methane emissions from applicable facilities.
3. Reports should allow operators to submit empirical emissions data in a manner prescribed by the EPA.

The document also suggests that the EPA should finalize the following changes:

1. Require reporting of large release events that are currently not reflected in Subpart W reporting and can cause significant harm to health.
2. Move towards improved and updated emission factors that better capture intermittent emissions and provide more accuracy for reporting.
3. Require operators to report higher emissions from malfunctioning equipment, as Subpart W does not accurately account for emissions from equipment malfunctions.

The document acknowledges that more work needs to be done to ensure the strongest possible emission safeguards are finalized by the EPA to protect public health. It suggests that the EPA should integrate top-down data to provide a clear picture of the overall accuracy of reported emissions, ensure precise statistical analysis and methods to account for intermittent emission events, and define safeguards and require independent verifications of self-reported measurements from oil and gas companies.

The document concludes by emphasizing the importance of protecting public health and the climate. It thanks the reader for their time and consideration.

Clean Connect AI Inc.,"The document is a response to the EPA's proposed revisions to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule for the petroleum and natural gas systems source category, specifically Subpart W. The response is in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which mandates revisions to ensure that reporting is based on empirical data and accurately reflects methane and waste emissions. The document addresses the EPA's request for comments on alternative methods for quantifying leaks.

The document introduces Clean Connect AI, a company that has created the first government-approved Autonomous LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair) solution using continuous OGI+AI (Optical Gas Imaging + Artificial Intelligence). The Colorado Department of Health and Environment has approved Clean Connect's OGI+AI system for Alt-AIMM (Alternative Approved Instrumentation Monitoring Method), allowing operators in Colorado to use it as an alternative to existing LDAR, AVO, and STEM regulations.

Clean Connect's OGI+AI system combines continuous-OGI camera technology with AI to detect and quantify VOC and methane gases. The document argues that OGI+AI qualifies as a direct emissions measurement method and can fulfill the EPA's requirements for Subpart W. It also highlights that ProMax, a site-specific engineering calculation software, is recognized in Subpart W as a valid measurement method and can be integrated with OGI+AI for accurate emissions measurement.

The document provides details on how Clean Connect's OGI+AI system measures leaks at the component level, including the configuration of OGI camera tour stops, identification of individual equipment or components, and integration with IIoT (Industrial Internet of Things) meter devices and ProMax v6. It also explains the architecture of Clean Connect's OGI+AI system, including edge computing, SCADA integration, and cloud-based data storage.

The document emphasizes the benefits of using OGI+AI for direct emissions measurement, including safety, real-time speed, accuracy, granularity, near real-time mass balance reconciliation, speciating the gas stream, tracking non-fugitive and permitted emissions, and near real-time GHG/methane intensity calculations.

The document argues that EPA should recognize OGI+AI as a valid measurement method and allow operators to use advanced technology to fulfill their obligations under Subpart W. It suggests that EPA should establish a timely process to approve new quantification solutions and set targets for quantification accuracy for each component type regulated under Subpart W.

Burton emphasizes that these findings align with a growing body of scientific and medical evidence demonstrating the adverse health impacts of oil and gas activities on nearby communities.

To address these concerns, Burton suggests that the EPA should utilize basin-level measurement data and top-down approaches, such as continuous aerial monitoring, to detect and quantify large emissions, particularly from super-emitters in the oil and gas industry. He recommends the use of continuous optical gas imaging (OGI) technology, which can detect gas leaks and provide more frequent and accurate data. Burton proposes that significant leaks should be repaired within five days, and emitters should be required to submit plans to prevent future emissions incidents.

Additionally, Burton urges the EPA to reduce the current reporting limit and methane emissions charge threshold from 25,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent (mt CO2e) to 10,000 mt CO2e, as originally proposed. He emphasizes the importance of reliable and consistent measurement of greenhouse gas emissions to effectively implement the provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) methane fee across the oil and gas industry. Burton also calls for mandatory, independent, third-party verification measures to ensure a level playing field among private firms in the industry and facilitate trustworthy information sharing between state and local environmental regulators.

In conclusion, Burton expresses gratitude for the opportunity to provide comments and commends the EPA for taking steps to address a significant source of climate warming emissions.

"Teledyne FLIR, LLC","The document is a submission from Teledyne FLIR (formerly FLIR Systems, Inc.) to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding the proposed standards for the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule. Teledyne FLIR is a company specializing in Optical Gas Imaging (OGI) technology for methane and VOC emissions mitigation in the oil and gas industry.

The submission highlights Teledyne FLIR's longstanding collaboration with the EPA, oil and gas industry, state regulatory agencies, and LDAR (Leak Detection and Repair) service providers to ensure effective and efficient emissions reduction in the oil and natural gas sector. Teledyne FLIR pioneered OGI technology with the release of the GasFindIR camera in 2005 and has since worked to incorporate innovative technologies for emissions mitigation while minimizing operational impact.

The company's goal is to support regulations that ensure environmental safety and public health in a feasible manner. Teledyne FLIR argues that OGI technology has been unfairly targeted in the proposed regulations and that it actually helps reduce emissions more effectively than other methods. They reference the Pacsi study, which only considers a small subset of information and fails to account for the larger number of leaks reported in states like Colorado.

Teledyne FLIR suggests that the ""OGI enhancement factor"" should be removed from the regulations to encourage operators to use advanced technology for emissions reduction without being penalized. They propose that if the EPA chooses to keep the enhancement factor, there should also be an ""OGI factor"" for emission factors based on population counts, allowing operators using OGI to report lower emissions compared to those using other methods.

The submission also addresses the request for comments on alternative methods for quantifying leaks. Teledyne FLIR highlights the advancements in Quantification of Optical Gas Imaging (QOGI) technology, which has been validated by third-party studies and proven to be more accurate than Method 21.
